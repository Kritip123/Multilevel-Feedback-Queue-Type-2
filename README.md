# Multilevel-Feedback-Queue-Type-2
This Scheduling is like Multilevel Queue(MLQ) Scheduling but in this process can move between the queues. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ) keep analyzing the behavior (time of execution) of processes and according to which it changes its priority.

Here, 4 queues are used and all of them uses Round Robin algorithm with time slice 2, 4, 6 and 8.
# Limitations
Here, no 2 processes can have the same arrival time, CPU burst time or the priority.
